# Spruce - NCBI Metadata Miner

Spruce is a collection of tools to retrieve metadata and organize it according to a user-defined ontology of terms.

A primary application is retrieving metadata from NCBI GenBank format records.

These scripts are in development -- additional documentation is in progress.
